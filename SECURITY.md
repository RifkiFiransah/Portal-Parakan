   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

3. **Response timeline**:
   - We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours

## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum with secure token management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected with CSRF tokens
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Eloquent ORM with parameterized queries
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt
- **File Upload Security**: MIME type validation and size limits
- **Rate Limiting**: API and form submission rate limiting
- **Session Security**: Secure session configuration
- **HTTPS**: SSL/TLS encryption for production

### Security Headers

```php
// Implemented security headers
'X-Frame-Options' => 'SAMEORIGIN',
'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff',
'X-XSS-Protection' => '1; mode=block',
'Strict-Transport-Security' => 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
'Content-Security-Policy' => "default-src 'self'",
'Referrer-Policy' => 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
```

### Database Security

- Encrypted sensitive data
- Regular backup with encryption
- Access control and monitoring
- SQL injection prevention
- Database user with minimal privileges

### File Security

- Upload path restrictions
- File type validation
- Size limitations
- Malware scanning (recommended)
- Secure file permissions

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   ```php
   // Always validate input
   $request->validate([
       'email' => 'required|email|max:255',
       'password' => 'required|string|min:8|confirmed',
   ]);
   ```

2. **Output Encoding**
   ```blade
   {{-- Use proper escaping --}}
   <p>{{ $user->name }}</p>
   <p>{!! html_entity_decode($content) !!}</p>
   ```

3. **Database Queries**
   ```php
   // Use Eloquent or Query Builder
   User::where('email', $email)->first();
   
   // Avoid raw queries
   DB::select('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [$email]);
   ```

4. **File Uploads**
   ```php
   // Validate file uploads
   $request->validate([
       'avatar' => 'required|image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg|max:2048',
   ]);
   ```

### For System Administrators

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Keep PHP and server software updated
   - Disable unnecessary PHP functions
   - Configure proper file permissions
   - Enable error logging (not display)

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Limit database user privileges
   - Enable SSL connections
   - Regular security updates

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up intrusion detection
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Log suspicious activities
   - Regular security audits
